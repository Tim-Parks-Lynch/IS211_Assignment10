Hi Professor,

Please ignore the python_sql_scripts.py file. I created that for myself to have in the future. I put a few functions in my helper_functions.py file to test if the file being connected to is a sql file and if the connection is successful. My music.sql file follows MySQL syntax and worked on my version of MySQL. It drops the music database if it exists and recreates it as well. Please let me know if you run into any issues with it.

Thanks!
